# Voice EQ Suggestion

## Task Description

This project is designed to automatically analyze audio files and generate starting EQ settings for vocal tracks.

A Python script located in the src/ directory:
- reads audio files from the data/ folder,
- analyzes their spectral content (optionally using vocal separation),
- computes recommended EQ parameters for vocals,
- saves the results in text format into the artifacts/ folder.

This is not an attempt to recover the exact EQ used in a finished song.  
It provides a practical starting point for further manual adjustment.
