# First Settings Android App

A lightweight single-screen Android app built with Kotlin and the Material Components library. The screen presents a few user-facing settings (dark mode, notifications, background sync, and a volume slider) and shows a status summary that updates as values change.

## Building
1. Open the `android/first` folder in Android Studio.
2. Let the IDE download any required SDK components.
3. Use **Run > Run 'app'** to install and launch the application on an emulator or device running Android 7.0 (API 24) or newer.
